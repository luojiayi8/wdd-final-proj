          <div class="answer">Figure out your tastes! Do you prefer sweet
          or bitter? Strong coffee flavor or light? Hot or iced?<br>
          Don't be intimidated... There's always your coffee-expert Professor Steinberg
          who goes up and recites the most complicated order you've ever heard. If you
          have no idea what a drink is, ask your friendly barista. <br>

        <div class="question">
          <div class ="icon"> + </div>Why is it important to understand coffee?
          <div class="answer">From impressing your friends to impressing your interviewer,
          there's plenty of reasons to briefly understand the different kinds of coffee.
          Others pick drinks based on caffeine content, to keep them awake and motivated
          through long workdays. Coffee is a part of your lifestyle.
          Understanding coffee is similar to knowing the most popular songs and movies,
          it has a cultural aspect!</div>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <div class ="icon"> + </div>Where does coffee come from?
          <div class="answer"> Coffee is a result of ground coffee beans.
            These coffee beans were native to tropical Africa,
            and Madagascar, and various parts near the Indian Ocean. Since
            then, it has been imported to many parts of the Americas and South
            Americas for optimal production. <br></div>

        <div class="question">
          <div class ="icon"> + </div>Can coffee cause allergic reactions?
          <div class="answer">
          Common ingredients in certain drinks
          are soy, cream, and milk. Make sure to watch out for these.
          Coffee itself is not a tree nut, but it is often packaged/seasoned without
          tree nuts and in some cases can causes allergies. If you are
          lactose intolerant, you can ask for soy or almond substitutes in place
          of milk for many drinks. <br></div>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <div class ="icon"> + </div>Does coffee affect your health?
          <div class="answer">Coffee is a stimulant. Research debates whether there
          are long-term benefits or harms of coffee. The media loves to tote a correlation between
          coffee and various big diseases (cancer, AIDS, heart disease, etc) but
          in reality there are few conclusive studies. Correlation is not causation!
          However, there is a general conclusion that coffee is
          safe to drink (but remember, everything in moderation!)</div>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <div class ="icon"> + </div>How do baristas make pretty designs in my coffee?
          <div class="answer">What you are seeing is probably known as latte art!
          It comes with a lot of experience. It involves the height and speed
          of pouring steamed milk into coffee. Heart and leaf shapes are often
          made this way. More intricate parts of designs are often
        "etched" with a tool after pouring. </div>

          <div class ="icon"> + </div>What is the chemical formula for caffeine?
